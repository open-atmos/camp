======

Run "./compile.libs.camp.sh" to compile CAMP from scratch

Run "./make.camp.power9.sh" to execute "TestMonarch.py" test

We recommend to use the file "TestMonarch.py" for testing the GPU branch. It includes multiple configuration variables, such as number of cells, case, MPI processes, etc. More info about the test can be found at "camp/test/monarch/".
