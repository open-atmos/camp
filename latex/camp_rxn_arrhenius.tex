Arrhenius-\/like reaction rate constant equations are calculated as follows\+:

\[
      Ae^{(\frac{-E_a}{k_bT})}(\frac{T}{D})^B(1.0+E*P)
    \]

where $A$ is the pre-\/exponential factor (\# $(\mbox{cm}^{-3})^{-(n-1)}\mbox{s}^{-1}$), $n$ is the number of reactants, $E_a$ is the activation energy (J), $k_b$ is the Boltzmann constant (J/K), $D$ (K), $B$ (unitless) and $E$ ( $Pa^{-1}$) are reaction parameters, $T$ is the temperature (K), and $P$ is the pressure (Pa). The first two terms are described in Finlayson-\/\+Pitts and Pitts (2000) {\bfseries [Finlayson-\/\+Pitts2000]} . The final term is included to accomodate CMAQ EBI solver type 7 rate constants.

Input data for Arrhenius equations has the following format\+:

 The key-\/value pairs {\bfseries{reactants}}, and {\bfseries{products}} are required. Reactants without a {\bfseries{qty}} value are assumed to appear once in the reaction equation. Products without a specified {\bfseries{yield}} are assumed to have a {\bfseries{yield}} of 1.\+0.

Optionally, a parameter {\bfseries{C}} may be included, and is taken to equal $\frac{-E_a}{k_b}$. Note that either {\bfseries{Ea}} or {\bfseries{C}} may be included, but not both. When neither {\bfseries{Ea}} or {\bfseries{C}} are included, they are assumed to be 0.\+0. When {\bfseries{A}} is not included, it is assumed to be 1.\+0, when {\bfseries{D}} is not included, it is assumed to be 300.\+0 K, when {\bfseries{B}} is not included, it is assumed to be 0.\+0, and when {\bfseries{E}} is not included, it is assumed to be 0.\+0. The unit for time is assumed to be s, but inclusion of the optional key-\/value pair {\bfseries{time}} {\bfseries{unit}} = {\bfseries{MIN}} can be used to indicate a rate with min as the time unit.
