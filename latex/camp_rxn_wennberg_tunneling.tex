Wennberg tunneling reaction rate constant equations are calculated as follows\+:

\[
      Ae^{(\frac{-B}{T})}e^{(\frac{C}{T^3})}
    \]

where $A$ is the pre-\/exponential factor ( $(\mbox{#}\,\mbox{cm}^{-3})^{-(n-1)}\mbox{s}^{-1}$), and $B$ and $C$ are parameters that capture the temperature dependence as described in Wennberg et al. (2018) {\bfseries [Wennberg2018]} .

Input data for Wennberg tunneling equations has the following format\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}

\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ :\ 123.45,}

 The key-\/value pairs {\bfseries{reactants}}, and {\bfseries{products}} are required. Reactants without a {\bfseries{qty}} value are assumed to appear once in the reaction equation. Products without a specified {\bfseries{yield}} are assumed to have a {\bfseries{yield}} of 1.\+0.

When {\bfseries{A}} is not included, it is assumed to be 1.\+0, when {\bfseries{B}} is not included, it is assumed to be 0.\+0 K, and when {\bfseries{C}} is not included, it is assumed to be 0.\+0 $\mbox{K}^3$. The unit for time is assumed to be s, but inclusion of the optional key-\/value pair {\bfseries{time}} {\bfseries{unit}} = {\bfseries{MIN}} can be used to indicate a rate with min as the time unit.
