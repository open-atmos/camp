Condensed-\/\+Phase Photolysis reactions take the form\+:

\[\ce{
   X + h $\nu$ -> Y_1 ( + Y_2 \dots )
 }\]

where $\ce{X}$ is the species being photolyzed, and $\ce{Y_n}$ are the photolysis products.

The reaction rate can be scaled by providing the "{}scaling factor"{} keyword in the json configuration.

Input data for condensed-\/phase Photolysis reactions have the following format\+:

 The key-\/value pairs {\bfseries{reactants}}, and {\bfseries{products}} are required. Reactants without a {\bfseries{qty}} value are assumed to appear once in the reaction equation. Products without a specified {\bfseries{yield}} are assumed to have a {\bfseries{yield}} of 1.\+0.

Units for the reactants and products must be specified using the key {\bfseries{units}} and can be either {\bfseries{M}} or {\bfseries{mol}} {\bfseries{m-\/3}}. If units of {\bfseries{M}} are specified, a key-\/value pair {\bfseries{aerosol-\/phase}} {\bfseries{water}} must also be included whose value is a string specifying the name for water in the aerosol phase.

The unit for time is assumed to be s, but inclusion of the optional key-\/value pair {\bfseries{time}} {\bfseries{unit}} = {\bfseries{MIN}} can be used to indicate a rate with min as the time unit.

The key-\/value pair {\bfseries{aerosol}} {\bfseries{phase}} is required and must specify the name of the aerosol-\/phase in which the reaction occurs.
