Photolysis reactions take the form\+:

\[\ce{
   X + h $\nu$ -> Y_1 ( + Y_2 \dots )
 }\]

where $\ce{X}$ is the species being photolyzed, and $\ce{Y_n}$ are the photolysis products.

Photolysis rate constants (including the $\ce{h $\nu$}$ term) can be constant or set from an external photolysis module using the {\ttfamily \doxylink{structcamp__rxn__photolysis_1_1rxn__update__data__photolysis__t}{camp\+\_\+rxn\+\_\+photolysis\+::rxn\+\_\+update\+\_\+data\+\_\+photolysis\+\_\+t}} object. External modules can use the {\ttfamily \doxylink{structcamp__rxn__photolysis_1_1rxn__photolysis__t_a9194b942fea553a27aa64d79c1f8d558}{camp\+\_\+rxn\+\_\+photolysis\+::rxn\+\_\+photolysis\+\_\+t\+::get\+\_\+property\+\_\+set()}} function during initilialization to access any needed reaction parameters to identify certain photolysis reactions. An {\ttfamily camp\+\_\+rxn\+\_\+photolysis\+::update\+\_\+data\+\_\+photolysis\+\_\+t} object should be initialized for each photolysis reaction. These objects can then be used during solving to update the photolysis rate from an external module.

Input data for photolysis reactions have the following format \+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ "{}type"{}\ :\ "{}PHOTOLYSIS"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ "{}reactants"{}\ :\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ "{}spec1"{}\ :\ \{\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ "{}products"{}\ :\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ "{}spec2"{}\ :\ \{\},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ "{}spec3"{}\ :\ \{\ "{}yield"{}\ :\ 0.65\ \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ "{}scaling\ factor"{}\ :\ 1.2,}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}
 The key-\/value pairs {\bfseries{reactants}}, and {\bfseries{products}} are required. There must be exactly one key-\/value pair in the {\bfseries{reactants}} object whose name is the species being photolyzed and whose value is an empty {\ttfamily json} object. Any number of products may be present. Products without a specified {\bfseries{yield}} are assumed to have a {\bfseries{yield}} of 1.\+0. The {\bfseries{scaling}} {\bfseries{factor}} is optional, and can be used to set a constant scaling factor for the rate constant. When the {\bfseries{scaling}} {\bfseries{factor}} is not provided, it is assumed to be 1.\+0. All other data is optional and will be available to external photolysis modules during initialization. Rate constants are in units of $s^{-1}$, and must be set using a {\ttfamily rxn\+\_\+photolysis\+\_\+update\+\_\+data\+\_\+t} object.
