Chemical species in the \doxysectlink{index}{camp-\/chem}{0} module are gas-\/ or aerosol-\/phase species that can participate in chemical or phase-\/transfer reactions in the \doxylink{camp_mechanism}{mechanism}. Each species must have a unique name (the same name cannot be used for a gas-\/phase species and an aerosol-\/phase species). Chemical species may be present either in the gas-\/phase or any number of \doxylink{camp_aero_phase}{aerosol phases}. For example, an aerosol-\/phase chemical species may be present in an "{}organic"{} and an "{}aqueous"{} \doxylink{camp_aero_phase}{aerosol phase}.

Chemical species data include physical constants and species-\/specific model parameters that are used during initialization to assemble reaction and sub-\/model data for use during solving. Note that chemical species data are {\bfseries{only}} available during initialization, and when using MPI are not passed to child nodes. The primary node will, however, have access to data in the {\ttfamily \doxylink{structcamp__camp__core_1_1camp__core__t_a6d0ccab2236a905514a49ee0a73dc557}{camp\+\_\+camp\+\_\+core\+::camp\+\_\+core\+\_\+t\+::chem\+\_\+spec\+\_\+data}} object for outputing model data (e.\+g., species names).

The input format for chemical species can be found \doxylink{input_format_species}{here}.
