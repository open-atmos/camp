A mechanism in the \doxysectlink{index}{camp-\/chem}{0} module is a set of \doxylink{camp_rxn}{reactions} that occur in the gas-\/phase or within one of several \doxylink{camp_aero_phase}{aerosol phases} or across an interface between two phases (gas or aerosol). One or several mechanisms may be included in a \doxysectlink{index}{camp-\/chem}{0} model run.

Every mechanism in a \doxysectlink{index}{camp-\/chem}{0} run will have access to the same set of \doxylink{camp_species}{chemical species} and \doxylink{camp_aero_phase}{aerosol phases}, so phase and species names must be consistent across all concurrently loaded mechanisms. The division of \doxylink{camp_rxn}{reactions} into distinct mechanisms permits a host model to specificy which mechanisms should be solved during a call to {\ttfamily \doxylink{structcamp__camp__core_1_1camp__core__t_a3c3d6c53f04ef7e6799dbac855ed9694}{camp\+\_\+camp\+\_\+core\+::camp\+\_\+core\+\_\+t\+::solve()}}.

The input format for mechanism data can be found \doxylink{input_format_mechanism}{here}.
